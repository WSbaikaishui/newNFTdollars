# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

try npm hardhat:

```shell    
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Try running :

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test test/sample-test.js   //as you want 
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/05-deploy-LoanPool.js
```
